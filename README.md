# Boosting-the-Equity-Momentum-Factor-in-Credit-and-Its-Continued-Significance-in-Convertible-Bonds

The intricate dance between equity and debt markets has long been a subject of fascination for financial scholars and practitioners alike. One of the most compelling phenomena in this realm is the equity momentum factor, a well-documented anomaly wherein stocks that have performed well in the recent past tend to continue outperforming, and vice versa. Recent research, notably by Kaufmann et al. [1], has expanded this concept to the corporate bond market, revealing that the momentum observed in equities can be harnessed to predict the movement of corporate bonds with significant accuracy.
However, a segment of the market that bridges the gap between pure equities and pure bonds remains relatively unexplored in this context: convertible bonds. These hybrid instruments, with their unique blend of bond-like safety and equity-like upside potential, present a compelling case for investigation.
Conventional valuation processes for convertible bonds are in some sense always one step behind the true market value. In order to validate the price of the convertible bond in either way, the trader has to gather enough information about both the firm and the market. That means instead of predicting the value of the convertible bonds in the near future, conventional traders can only validate the value of convertible bonds in the path and seek for arbitrage opportunities. The finding by Kaufmann et al.has introduced an opportunity in which using the past momentum traders can predict the future value of a convertible bond and actively create arbitrage opportunities.
